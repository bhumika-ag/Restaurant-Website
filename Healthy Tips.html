<h1>Healthy Tips for a Healthy Life</h1>
The start of a new decade brings with it new resolutions to improve one’s life, 
including a healthier lifestyle. Here are a few practical health tips to help you start 
off towards healthy living in 2021.

<h3>Eat a healthy diet</h3>
Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts 
and whole grains. Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables 
per day. You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including 
veggies in your meal; eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of 
fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce
your risk of malnutrition and noncommunicable 
<br>
diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.
<h3>Consume less salt and sugar</h3>

Filipinos consume twice the recommended amount of sodium, putting them at risk 
of high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. 
Most people get their sodium through salt. Reduce your salt intake to 5g per day, 
equivalent to about one teaspoon. It’s easier to do this by limiting the amount of salt, 
soy sauce, fish sauce and other high-sodium condiments when preparing meals; 
removing salt, seasonings and condiments from your meal table; avoiding salty snacks; 
and choosing low-sodium products.
On the other hand, consuming excessive amounts of sugars increases the risk of tooth 
decay and unhealthy weight gain. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars 
should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to 50g or 
about 12 teaspoons for an adult. WHO recommends consuming less than 5% of total 
energy intake for additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intake by limiting 
the consumption of sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages.
<h3>Reduce intake of harmful fats</h3>

Fats consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. 
This will help prevent unhealthy weight gain and NCDs. There are different 
types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over saturated fats and trans-fats. 
WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; 
reducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both 
saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats.
The preferable unsaturated fats are found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, 
soybean, canola and olive oils; saturated fats are found in fatty meat, butter, palm and 
coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard; and trans-fats are found in baked and fried 
foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, cookies, biscuits, and 
cooking oils and spreads.
<h3>Avoid harmful use of alcohol</h3>

There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health 
problems such as mental and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, 
major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis, some cancers and heart diseases, as well as injuries 
resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.
The liver is an organ which helps break down and remove harmful substances from 
your body, including alcohol. Long-term alcohol use interferes with this process. 
It also increases your risk for chronic liver inflammation and liver disease. The scarring 
caused by this inflammation is known as cirrhosis. The formation of scar tissue 
destroys the liver. As the liver becomes increasingly damaged, it has a harder 
time removing toxic substances from your body.
The pancreas helps regulate your body’s insulin use and response to glucose. 
When your pancreas and liver aren’t functioning properly, you run the risk of 
experiencing low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. 
<h3>Do not SMOKE</h3>

Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. 
Tobacco kills not only the direct smokers but even non-smokers through second-hand 
exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino adults who smoke tobacco
 but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit.
If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience 
immediate and long-term health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not 
start smoking and fight for your right to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air.
No matter how you smoke it, tobacco is dangerous to your health. There are no safe 
substances in any tobacco products, from acetone and tar to nicotine and carbon
monoxide. The substances you inhale don’t just affect your lungs. They can affect 
your entire body.Smoking can lead to a variety of ongoing complications in the body, 
as well as long-term effects on your body systems. While smoking can increase 
your risk of a variety of problems over several years, some of the bodily effects are immediate.
